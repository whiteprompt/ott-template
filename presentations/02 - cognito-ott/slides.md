# AWS Cognito

### What is Cognito?

- AWS Cognito is a simple user identity service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data for your users across their devices.

<br><br>

### Benefits of using Cognito?

- Easy configuration. 
- Triggers
- Securely store sensitive information of the user
- Amplify library can fit several use cases

<br><br>

### Caveats
- Pool settings should be set at creation time. 
<!--
- **Easy configuration**. 
    - Creating user pools is very easy, and provides several options.
    - Like Social SignIn.
    - Force password change.
    - Forgot password flow.
    - Automatic emails.
- **Triggers**
  - Like Pre sign-up triggers. if the user login with email/password and after login with google using the same email.
    the trigger will merge both users to prevent duplication.
- **Securely store sensitive info of the user**
  - Like password or any information we prefer not to store on our database.
- **Amplify library can fit several use cases**
  - Hosted UI
  - Prebuilt components
  - Authentication methods to call manually
  - Refresh token functionality free

Caveats
- **Pool settings should be set at creation time.**
  - Once the pool is created if you need to change something, you must recreate the pool
